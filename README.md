Objective:
- To develop a flutter project that make use of widgets
- To develop a flutter project that make use of HTTP library for fetching data/img online
- To develop a flutter project that make use of firebase for authentication

Summary:
The code is about time tracker app. I learned how to create a Firebase project, configure Firebase for Android, configuring Firebase for iOS, installing the firebase_core and firebase_auth packages and also to initializing the Firebase App.


To use this project with Firebase, some configuration steps are required:

1. Create a new project with the Firebase console.
2. Add iOS and Android apps in the Firebase project settings.
3. On Android, use com.codingwithflutter.time_tracker_flutter_course as the package name.
4. Download and copy google-services.json into android/app.
5. On iOS, use com.codingwithflutter.timeTrackerFlutterCourse as the bundle ID.
6. Download and copy GoogleService-Info.plist into iOS/Runner, and add it to the Runner target in Xcode.



p/s: Assalam Sir. I apologize for doing this assignment alone because I was not feeling very well for few days, so I choose to do it alone so I won't burden anyone else. Hopefully you will accept my work. Thank you.
